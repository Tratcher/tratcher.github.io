# Dream With Me

5-Dec-99\
Between these pages\
There is nothing to read\
Nothing to see\
And nothing to share\
My dreams are mine\
And whoever I wish to share them with\
To read further\
Is to discover my world\
And those who discover my world\
Discover me\
And everything I hold secret\
Behind agreeing eyes.\
Let me dream my dreams\
And I will let you dream yours\
~ Chris Ross
                                               
                                                

### Programming the Poet
11-Apr-04\
All day the thoughts are becoming,\
Each engendering more\
Possibilities compounding\
Anticipation building
 
Until it bursts forth\
Streaming jumbledly\
A dozen lines to a thought,\
A dozen thoughts to a line,\
A senseless mass\
All around me
 
This? This is my masterpiece?\
This wreck of letters, garbled lines\
Lame but limping along in\
Singsong naivety?
 
Hack Slash Shuffle Sew\
Re-arrange Re-assemble
 
Smoother Quicker Better now\
Though despite the blinding imperfections\
It shows what I have to tell.
