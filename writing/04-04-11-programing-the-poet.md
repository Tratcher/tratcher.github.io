###### 11-Apr-04<br>
All day the thoughts are becoming,<br>
Each engendering more<br>
Possibilities compounding<br>
Anticipation building
 
Until it bursts forth<br>
Streaming jumbledly<br>
A dozen lines to a thought,<br>
A dozen thoughts to a line,<br>
A senseless mass<br>
All around me
 
This? This is my masterpiece?<br>
This wreck of letters, garbled lines<br>
Lame but limping along in<br>
Singsong naivety?
 
Hack Slash Shuffle Sew<br>
Re-arrange Re-assemble
 
Smoother Quicker Better now<br>
Though despite the blinding imperfections<br>
It shows what I have to tell.
