###### 1999 March 12<br>
The echo of voices<br>
Long ago gone<br>
An eternity of pain<br>
Vanquished forever<br>
Peace now eternal<br>
Brighter and brighter<br>
Forever now my own<br>
I say goodnight to this world<br>
And good morning to another<br>
The reality at an end<br>
A fable now forever<br>
Goodnight<br>
Goodnight<br>
And good morning<br>

Babylon 5 is my favorite TV series. This was written after watching the series finale (Season 5, episode 22) "Sleeping in Light".<br>
