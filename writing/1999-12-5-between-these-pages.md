###### 1999 December 5<br>
Between these pages<br>
There is nothing to read<br>
Nothing to see<br>
And nothing to share<br>
My dreams are mine<br>
And whoever I wish to share them with<br>
To read further<br>
Is to discover my world<br>
And those who discover my world<br>
Discover me<br>
And everything I hold secret<br>
Behind agreeing eyes.<br>
Let me dream my dreams<br>
And I will let you dream yours<br>
~ Chris Ross

This poem was written at the start of a new notebook and I've traditionally included it at the start of any collection I've shared.
