###### 2000 December 14<br>
Today is the day<br>
Your enemies have gone too far<br>
Your brothers have betrayed you<br>
And you have found friends<br>
You never knew you had<br>
Today is the day<br>
You stood up for your beliefs<br>
You stood up for your humanity<br>
You stood up to save the worlds<br>
Today is the day<br>
The day they came for you<br>
The day you stood your ground<br>
The day all hell broke loose among the stars<br>
Today you have done what you must<br>
In order to save us all<br>

  <summary>Background</summary>
Babylon 5 is my favorite TV series. This was written after watching Season 3, episode 10 "Severed Dreams". This is the most powerful episode in the series.<br>
<br>
"Delenn: Babylon 5 is under our protection. Withdraw or be destroyed! ... Only one human captain has ever survived battle with a Minbari Fleet. He is behind me. You are in front of me. If you value your lives, be somewhere else!"<br>
