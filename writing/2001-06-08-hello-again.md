###### 2001 June 8<br>
Hello again<br>
How long has it been<br>
Since we've spoken face to face<br>
Almost a year one'd think<br>
But I've seen your sweet smile every place<br>
Walking down a random hallway<br>
I'd see your silent wave<br>
Followed by a silent smile<br>
From your pretty face<br>
I'd always return it<br>
The least I could do<br>
With a friendly<br>
How do you do<br>
And walk on by<br>
In a slightly better mood<br>
Thank you for all the smiles<br>
Over the endless year it's been<br>
Maybe we'll get together and talk awhile<br>
Or just smile and wave again<br>
