###### 2001 July 15<br>
Gazing peacefully<br>
As something settles<br>
Gently in my soul<br>
The beauty of<br>
The mists<br>
The rain<br>
The grandness of the mountains<br>
The silent elegance<br>
In every tree<br>
As they dance<br>
So gracefully<br>
In a gentle breeze<br>
Nothing left<br>
To cloud my view<br>
The matter settled<br>
Within myself<br>
Nothing left<br>
Of a child's resentment<br>
As I finally realize<br>
Where I belong<br>
Here<br>
In this half-lit world<br>
Of birds and squirrels<br>
Living the rhythm<br>
Of rain drops on maple leaves<br>
The rhythm<br>
The sound<br>
Caressing every sense<br>
Drowning the worries<br>
Of a life far-away<br>
Anything left<br>
Pressed into word<br>
Left and forgotten<br>
But for days<br>
When life kills the rhythm<br>
And the heart needs reminder<br>
Of what it felt like<br>
The total serenity<br>
A rest from the storm<br>
A reminder of why<br>
This life is worth living<br>
And this place worth staying<br>
And the hard times enduring<br>
So here lies<br>
All the blissful thoughts<br>
The unshed tears<br>
And the lost dreams<br>
In hope of saving what I have<br>
And enduring the storm<br>
