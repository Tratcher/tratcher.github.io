###### 2001 October 9<br>
Alone, together<br>
Alone together<br>
Two lost souls<br>
So very much alone<br>
Now alone together<br>
Sharing the dreams<br>
Of nights spent waking<br>
Spilling the tears<br>
Of hearts left aching<br>
Enjoying the company<br>
Of being alone<br>
Together<br>
 
Shall we search for the lost souls<br>
Or shall we let them be<br>
Forever in tears and sorrow<br>
To hide their natural beauty<br>
 
Stumbling round the dark<br>
One into another<br>
Distracted from their tears<br>
By the littlest of company<br>
Leaving two who were miserably alone<br>
Happily together<br>
 
Shall we search for the lost souls<br>
Or shall we let them find each other<br>
