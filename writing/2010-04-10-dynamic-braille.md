title: Dynamic Braille
---

###### 2010 April 10<br>
I've had this idea wandering around in the back of my head for almost 10 years, but discussing it with Tom I
realized that I've never taken the time to explain it to anybody or even write it down. <br>
<br>
I want to build a braille computer monitor based on this toy. <br>
<br>
Goals & proposed methods: 
- Dynamic braille text interface - Easy because braille is just a font. 
- 3d rendering of arbitrary GUIs & content - Big software problem 
- Force feedback, genuine touch interface - Hardware problem, GUI design problem 
<br>

Challenges: 
- Frame rate and sudden changes in depth 
- Color, not even gray scale 
- Convert 2d color images to 3d monotone representations 
- Resolution, individual pixel size as well as total screen size 
- Notifying the user that something has changed even when they don't touch it 
- Custom GUI design
- Existing software adaptation
