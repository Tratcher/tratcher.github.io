## Introduction

This is a collection of poems and other things I've written over the years. It ranges from philosophical to emotional, well formed to half baked. If you'd like to discuss anything here feel free to contact me at the e-mail address listed in my github profile.

### History

While I've been an avid reader much of my life, I only started personal writing in 8th grade. My 8th grade english teacher gave us the choice of writing short stories or poems. Given writing a few lines or a few pages, the choice seemed obvious for the efficient (lazy :grin:) person that I am. The poems didn't even have to rhyme or follow any specific structure. The main guidance we were given was to date and save everything.

A few early poems were published digitally and physically through poetry.com, though in hindsight their business model was to sell you books by putting you in them (I never bought any).
